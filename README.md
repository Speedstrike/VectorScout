# VectorScout
This is a scouting app designed for FRC team Vector 8177, and it includes features such as match scouting, pit scouting, and competition mode al built in, as well as an option to summarize scouting trends from recent events.

## How it works
Every year for each new game that gets released, the app will get updated with new firmware and scouting templates to match that year's competition, so all you have to do is input your scouting data in the built in scouting template, and export it to a location of your choice on your phone! Everything is presented in a very minimalist way, and there are support texts when you don't know what to do.

## Features
- Does not require internet to work!
- Built in match scouting and pit scouting template for each year
- Competition mode for a built in FRC event scouting bracket
- Ability to view scouting data/trends in real time
- Clean and simple user interface that's easy to understand and use
